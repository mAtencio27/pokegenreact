  "description": "Crownxo, the regal fire-type pokemon, is a noble creature that can often be found looming atop volcanic lava-flows. It emanates a powerful orange and black aura that makes its regal crown appear as if it were crafted from fire itself. This pokemon's remarkable abilities allow it to shoot out intense flames from its eyes to scorch its opponents and also deliver powerful smacks that can knock its victims into submission. In its natural habitat, Crownxo will usually keep a watchful eye over the bustling activity of other pokemon, as if it were the king of the volcano.",
