  "description": "Mysto is an elusive and mysterious Pok\u00e9mon found living among the tall towers and ancient walls of castle-like environments. Its wide eyes and pointed ears give off an air of wisdom, while its calm and inquisitive nature reveals a creature that is constantly observing and learning. When threatened, it can use its Nudge ability to quickly dart away or its Mystery Slash ability to surprise opponents with its hidden power. When not using its impressive defensive capabilities, Mysto spends its days taking in the sights and exploring its surroundings, collecting knowledge and slowly growing in power.",
