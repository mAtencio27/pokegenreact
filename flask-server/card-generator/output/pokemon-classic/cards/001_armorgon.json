  "description": "Armorgon is a unique Pokemon that can be found in dark, cave-like environments. It is closely related to both steel and rock-type Pokemon and is protected by its gray and brown armor-like shell. Its primary ability is called Magnet Bomb and allows it to manipulate nearby metallic objects. Armorgon tends to laze about during the day, but when night falls, it can be seen patrolling its cave home for any intruders. It is an incredibly strong Pokemon and should not be taken lightly.",
