  "description": "Leafleo is a mysterious and elusive Legendary Pokemon with white fur. It is an elusive creature of the wild, rarely seen prowling the lush jungle floors. Most assume it to have feline characteristics, but no one has been brave enough to get close enough to confirm. Its two mysterious powers, Foliage Lash and Petal Burst, are said to be used by Leafleo to protect its home from intruders. During the day, Leafleo can be found in its deep jungle home, keeping watch over its domain with curious eyes.",
