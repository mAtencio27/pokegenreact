  "description": "The elusive Heirow is a mysterious pokemon native to the smouldering volcanoes of its homelands. Though made of plastic, it is a surprisingly durable creature that is able to survive the scorching heat of its natural environment. During the day, it can be seen hopping around the slopes of its home volcanoes, where it uses its ability to exhale a jet of flames to create gentle paths up or down its steep surroundings. As the sun sets, Heirow will come to a stop and gaze out into the horizon, sometimes seen setting off a spark of fire in the night sky.",
