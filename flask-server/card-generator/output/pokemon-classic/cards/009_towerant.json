  "description": "Towerant is a rare and majestic sight to behold, with its golden wings shimmering in the twilight. Towerant may live in castle-like environments, but it is far from a sedentary pokemon. In the dark of night, Towerant is out and about, flitting around in search of prey. Its Dark Pulse and Knock Off abilities help it to quickly and accurately take down its targets. Towerant is an untamable wild spirit, always on the move and ever ready for battle.",
