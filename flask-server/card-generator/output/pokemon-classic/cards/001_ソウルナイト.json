  "description": "Soullight's regal armor stands out among the cave-like environments it calls home. It spends its days nuzzling against cave walls to sense the vibrations of nearby foes and allies alike. On rare occasions, it has even been known to lay gentle, glowing feathers forward in warning, an indication of its ability to manipulate mana to combat its adversaries. Its powerful claws make it incredibly skilled in picking and swiping its foes, and its powerful mind makes it an unbeatable strategic foe.",
