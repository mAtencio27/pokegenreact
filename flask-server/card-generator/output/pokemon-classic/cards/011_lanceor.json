  "description": "Lanceor is a majestic and powerful Pokemon that can often be found in mountainous regions. It wields a lance with a unique blend of gray and brown earth tones that matches its rocky environment, and its armor-like scales are no match for most attacks. It spends its days patrolling and protecting its turf with its signature move, Metal Burst, which can unleash a powerful and destructive shockwave of metallic energy. Don't underestimate its ferocity and strength; Lanceor is a formidable opponent with a ferocity that should not be underestimated.",
