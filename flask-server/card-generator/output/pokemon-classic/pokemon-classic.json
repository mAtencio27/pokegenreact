To protect itself, it has clothed itself in an armor of sparkling amethyst, the glimmer of which can be seen from miles away. Although it can be quite skittish, its calm demeanor belies its formidable powers of Mindzap and Telekinesis. During the day, it can be found levitating high above the ground, silently observing and meditating on its surroundings.",
