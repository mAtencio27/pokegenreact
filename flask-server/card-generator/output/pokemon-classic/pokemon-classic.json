It can often be spotted skittering along the shoreline and over watery surfaces, startling any creatures it meets along the way. Its unique Siphon ability allows it to absorb the surrounding environment and use the energy absorbed to energize itself and its allies. No matter what it's up to, this curious pokemon is sure to be a source of delight and entertainment.",
