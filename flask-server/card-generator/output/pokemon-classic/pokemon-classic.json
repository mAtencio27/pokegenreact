      "description": "Armarchite is a mysterious pokemon, which once lurked in the shadows and depths of crypt-like environments. It is now seen rarely and has become something of a legend. It is wearing ancient, white armor, and is endowed with great power and determination. Armarchite is known to spend its days meditating and plotting its next moves, never taking its eyes off its opponents. It moves with grace and understanding, able to sense the potential for conflict within any battle. When it does fight, it will do so swiftly and decisively, using its Astral Ring ability to bring swift and decisive victory.",
