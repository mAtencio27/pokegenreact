      "description": "Gothrune is a mysterious pokemon that is rarely seen, though its ominous presence can be felt in the shadows of wood-like environments. Covered in dark armor, this pokemon is surprisingly agile, able to slip in and out of hiding with incredible speed. Despite its intimidating exterior, Gothrune is gentle by nature, often taking time out of its day to admire the beauty of nature. It is able to defend itself by using its Floral Crush ability, which it uses to create stunning displays of power to ward off danger.",
