Its yellow and teal armor provides it with a unique look, and it is rarely seen without its signature electric aura surrounding it. When it is time to hunt, Voltex scans its terrain with lightning-like speed and agility to find its prey. It can remain perfectly still for hours, waiting for the perfect moment to unleash its powerful Thunderstorm ability and devour its unsuspecting prey. Voltex is an intimidating force of nature and is a sight to behold.",
