It has a peaceful nature and is often seen spending its day in solitude, enjoying the serenity of its surroundings. Despite its tranquil demeanor, it is not to be underestimated; its Giga Slam and Slash techniques are a force to be reckoned with. One must be careful when crossing paths with Sentinel, just as it takes care when it crosses paths with others.",
