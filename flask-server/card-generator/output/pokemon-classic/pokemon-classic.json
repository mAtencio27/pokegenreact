The crystalline armor of \u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u30cd\u30b3 is a symbol of its strength and spirit, and serves as a reminder of its natural affinity for the water. It is fiercely loyal and playful, often using its Tidal Shock ability to create waves in its environment in order to entertain itself and its trainers. This water-type Pokemon has an impressive Scratch attack, and is a formidable opponent to any would-be challengers!",
